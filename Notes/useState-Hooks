{ useState Hook }
The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

usestate hook is use for when you want to track data or something and update on click then you don't need to declare a varible/state and add functionality on it, you simply use React feature called useState() Hook 
here is the example :

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // 0 is the initial state value

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

count is the state variable (initialized with 0).
setCount is the function used to update count.
Clicking the button increases the count by 1.


Note: Summary => [UseState]

with the theState hook, the state doesnt have to be an object
The useState hook returns an array with 2 element 
the first element is the currcent value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function.
